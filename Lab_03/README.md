# Assignment nr 2

## Task description

We will continue working with the publication data imported in Microproject 2. This time, you need to write a query that calculates the publication score for each employee as follows. The value of a given publication for each author is the number of points for that publication (column Points) divided by the number of authors (column Authors). An employeeâ€™s publication score is the sum of points from their 4 highest-value publications.

For example, if Kowalski published one paper worth 200 points with 9 co-authors, one paper worth 140 points with 1 co-author, and three solo-authored papers worth 200, 140, and 100 points, then the values of these publications for him are: 200/10=20, 140/2=70, 200/1=200, 140/1=140, and 100/1=100. Thus, his publication score is 200+140+100+70 = 510.

You should submit a single text file containing the CREATE and INSERT statements from the previous microproject along with one SELECT statement that executes the query described above.
